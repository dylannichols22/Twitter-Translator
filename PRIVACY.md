# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-31

## Summary
This extension translates Chinese Twitter/X content using the Anthropic (Claude) API. To do that, the
extension sends tweet text (and optional context like author, timestamp, and URL) to Anthropic.

## Data We Collect
We do not collect or sell user data. We do not run analytics. We do not store your personal data on our servers.

## Data Sent to Third Parties
When you translate, tweet content is sent to Anthropic for processing. The data sent may include:
- Tweet text
- Author name (if present on the page)
- Timestamp (if present on the page)
- Tweet URL (if present on the page)

The user provides their own Anthropic API key in the extension settings. The key is stored locally in the
browser's extension storage and is not transmitted anywhere except to Anthropic when making translation requests.

## Local Storage
The extension stores:
- Your Anthropic API key (local extension storage)
- Settings like comment limit
- Cached translations (session storage) to reduce repeated token use
- Saved cards (if you use the save feature)

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, email: sloppyjenkins@gmail.com

## Hosting Requirement (AMO)
AMO requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL. Host this file (for example, in a GitHub repo) and
use that URL in the AMO listing.
